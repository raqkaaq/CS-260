    <hr>
    <p class="fonts section about">I suppose an about page should have something about me and why I decided to get into photography. Unfortunately that never happened so I would 
      just have to disappoint you. You see, I like making squares out of tinfoil and as is well known the two talents do not coincide. Additionally I
      would say the sky is blue, but really it isn't. The blue only comes from sunlight at specific frequencies being refracted away by the oxygen in the 
      atmosphere. So the sky is actually red, with a bit of white around the edges since all the light is refracted from further distances. About the color blue,
      it is interesting, as high energy blue (also called UV) is what gives people sunburns. So if you are feeling blue after reading all the nonsense I wrote
      just think of it as a friendly sunburn :)!
