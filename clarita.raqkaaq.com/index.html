		<h1 id=cursive>My Dearest Clarita,</h1>
		<p>I love you, I love all the cute little mannerisms you have and I love the way you say things. Its absolutely adorable how you tell me 'wait', its soo cute. I love how your mind works and how much you try at everything you do. You really are an inspiration to me. I love how you text me every morning when you wake up, and every night before you go to sleep. I feel so grateful to know that I have you in my life. I love being able to call you cute names, I love how your face scrunches up when I tell you that you are beautiful. You own my heart and I can't wait to be married to you forever and ever. You are the best thing that has ever happened to me!!</p>

		<p>I love you sooooooo much muffin</p>
		<p>Always and forever</p>
		<p>Your Eli</p>
