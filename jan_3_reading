DNS - Domain Name Service, client specifies name of server, and DNS returns ip
TCP - Transmission Control Protocol, client specifies ip and port, tcp establishes connection
	common ports:
		80 - HTTP web server
		443 - HTTPS server
		25, 465 - common for emails
		22 - SSH
IP - internet protocol, each packet of a request is sent along routers following these rules
	packets are recieved in a buffer, which can slow or stop transmission,
	for lost packets TCP will resend the packets, but this causes a delay

W3C standardizes web protocols such as HTML and CSS
IETF standardizes internet protocols such as HTTP, TCP and IP
IEEE standardizes link protocals such as Wifi and Ethernet
